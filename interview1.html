        <p class="h4-d-interview">1. As we say in English &quot;The journey of a thousand miles starts with the first step&quot;. So we are interested in how was your first step towards physics? </p>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p class="body-d-interview">Physics is integrated in our daily life. It&#x27;s very difficult to point out a particular incidence or a thing that can trigger our interest in physics. We live in physics all the time no matter which discipline or profession one&#x27;s following, it perhaps depends upon the natural tendencies of one to might get interested in exploring the things further or one may just use it, so it&#x27;s an endless journey. </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="interview-content">
      <div class="left">
        <p class="h4-d-interview">2. BSc in physics from Patna University, then MSC, and then PhD in nuclear physics from IIT Kanpur. How was your academic journey from the perspective of a student? Which life do you remember the most, which college do you remember the most? </p>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p class="body-d-interview">Since I was at the plus 1 level, I was very fortunate that we had such excellent faculties and various facilities, like sliding boards, were present in labs back in the 1970s. IIT Kanpur, on the other hand, had those boards installed in 2018 which made them proud. Later, Patna Science College contributed in laying a strong foundation which helped me to overcome the language barrier of English language. Initially, the limitations and difficulties in listening, speaking and writing papers were very high. But the faculties helped me withstand those adversities. The foundation that was crafted there was then nurtured by IIT Kanpur. It broadened my vision and innovation, as knowledge was not confined to just textbook syllabus but to real-life research and applications. </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="interview-content">
      <div class="left">
        <p class="h4-d-interview">3. Nowadays students hesitate to pursue basic science courses. They choose engineering or some other courses for job security... How do you see this scenario? </p>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p class="body-d-interview">Well, I&#x27;ll just say to let it go. The nature takes its course. I have encountered many cases where people have gone against their natural wishes and natural tendency. And as far as you say for job security, I have been received emails for the last 30 years. The students who are in second-year, they all say that it&#x27;s not their cup of tea. They wanted to peruse pure science. Even people who have gone through the whole process and now in a profession, well settled but are unhappy because of the work pressure and most importantly, it is something that they don&#x27;t like. So, I was very fortunate that I was not swayed Away by all these things. Because my thinking was, no one can control the future. You can plan, but then if you think that if I do this, then this will happen, that is unrealistic. So, it&#x27;s best to live in the present, enjoy your present, and develop your skills. The thing which was in my mind was no matter what kind of stream I chose, if I have skills, then I can do well. And if you don&#x27;t have that skill, to acquire it, you should have your whole heart in it. I wanted to be a teacher from the very beginning and as I was fortunate enough to have teachers with such high commitment towards the students, it encouraged me even further. Even today if s teacher puts up a happy face in the class, the students get motivated. But if the teacher himself is showing frustration and signs of unhappiness and irritation, students won&#x27;t go for that kind of profession. So, for me all these things were the reasons why I chose to go for the pure sciences. &quot;You be in whatever you enjoy&quot;, that will motivate one to acquire the skills to excel. </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="interview-content">
      <div class="left">
        <p class="h4-d-interview">4. While preparing for an interview, I found my copy of Physics and went through all the memories of 11th &amp; 12th so I wanted to ask you what encouraged you to write a book because you were not an author before, and you have not written any book. So what encouraged you to write such a book and did you follow any particular procedure while writing it? </p>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p class="body-d-interview">I was new in 1984, and I was working full-time on the book apart from my college duties. In those four years, my experience was that Physics is a subject that should be packaged and delivered according to the lifestyle of audience. As I said in the beginning, we all live in physics. So, if in the name of physics, I teach something that is not connected to student’s lives, they won&#x27;t receive it. For them, it will just be a collection of formulas, equations, descriptions, and definitions. But somehow if I can touch their normal life and then make this connection of physics with the actual world, actual surroundings, then the grasping will be high. Somewhere I was feeling that no, I&#x27;m not able to make a student love physics. Even after relating concepts to daily life, I couldn&#x27;t see the spark in them so then the analysis was they did not have a backup to revise things, which was done in the class. And since they have so many subjects to read. There should be a book to revise in correspondence to what is taught in class. So that is how this whole idea came up that, I should write an authentic book. The analytic power of students is developed and at the same time, students keep smiling now and then while reading the book. </p>

    </div>
    <div class="interview-content">
      <div class="left">
        <p class="h4-d-interview">5. One fictitious question if you would have given a chance to go in the past and work with any physicist then who would it be and why? </p>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p class="body-d-interview">I know it&#x27;s a really hard question for me to think about because people have worked hard and are very innovative in research. If I think about grading it, it&#x27;s very difficult.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="interview-content">
      <div class="left">
        <p class="h4-d-interview">6. While preparing for an interview, I went through your website and one notification that was highlighted was if you have any Bhajan related to Sun praising then send it to me on the Website it was given something. So it got my attention how you connect the old Indian culture with the new science because sometimes it is projected on us like two different things that the cultural book and the science book cannot be same. So how do you connect these two things? </p>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p class="body-d-interview">I disagree with the perspective of compartmentalizing life. Life is of an integrated nature and cannot be compartmentalized. Whether ancient or modern, cultural or social, or pure science, everything should be considered together. I dismiss the need for such compartmentalization, asserting the impossibility of having two or three lives simultaneously. The notion of separating culture is scientifically incorrect. My perspective is, ancient culture holds significant importance and, in ancient times, there was no compartmentalization. Science, culture, religion, and traditions were all integrated. Physics is something in which we all live. Connections are always there, and people need to feel that connection rather than me forcing it. During the COVID period, it was so demoralizing and frustrating in society, I encouraged activities like the Chat Pooja, worship to the Sun God, and shared the positive experiences of people writing wonderful things during that time. Even about ancient Indian surgery, various ancient physicians and surgeons, including Sushruth and Charak, whose teachings are still used as textbooks. An excavation where human teeth with evidence of root canal treatment dating back 7000 years were discovered. The advanced technology in ancient India allowed such procedures and discussed the reproduction of the entire scene by a research group using modern microscopy. Pointing out the overenthusiastic interpretations of certain aspects of ancient practices, I caution against attributing surgical explanations to mythological elements. Research by Saroj Bala, who uses astrophysics software to analyze astronomical constellations and eclipses described in Valmiki Ramayana, establishes a correlation with historical events. Considering the richness of our scientific society still, there is a need for honesty in acknowledging the contributions of Western scientists. </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="interview-content">
      <div class="left">
        <p class="h4-d-interview">7. How do you connect our old culture with science? Many times, they are shown to us as two different poles.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p class="body-d-interview">who has used that astrophysics software to look at the astronomical constellations and those eclipses which are described in Valmiki Ramayana, the sequence which is there, is very interesting. the birth of Rama, going to Vishwamitra then going to that Forest fighting with Kharshan, fighting with ravan coming back. From that software she could relate to that yes, in that particular sequence the things which are described, are the stars on nakshatras and all those things involve Maker Mine. This software predicts that okay, if they go some 5-6000 years ago, that kind of sequence events did happen. So, these kinds of things one should highlight, one should let people know that our tradition is not only in doing all these rituals. But it was a very high-quality of scientific society. Our experimentation, our Theory, and our philosophy were indeed very rich. We have very clear evidence for that. Now it&#x27;s okay fine, but it doesn&#x27;t mean that the westerns who have done that modern research in their science are insignificant. It is some 500 years old. But the kind of things that they have done in which we lag, we should give them full credit for that. Newton coming out with rule of gravitation is a very great thing. Although people over- enthusiastically say that Suri Siddhanta mentions all those things that there is a gravitational power in the earth. But the beauty of Newton&#x27;s discovery is that, the same rule is applied to describe the motion of the moon and the motion of a stone near the ground. This is a remarkably great discovery! We have to be honest with ourselves. It&#x27;s fine that you love your culture and tradition. But one has to be honest. The government of India is very keen on Indian knowledge system, It&#x27;s indeed very rich. But what people are doing now is just Somehow finding some things to highlight. The Indian knowledge system is very rich in the kind of medicinal knowledge it contains. Not an Ayurvedic person, but just a common villager who has so much knowledge. At my place, there are so many plants organized, and structured which are sown and taken care of. There were some small plants which grow on their own and went unnoticed. Today one person from my Village told me by pointing out a very small plant, he said that if there is a cut in your finger you take these particular leaves and then put its juice on the wound it immediately gets cured. This is the Indian knowledge system which not there in textbooks. It&#x27;s not there in Sushrut and other literature, but people know it. This has to be put in front of the people, in the right perspective. But somehow, we are all lost in some equations, and descriptions, not looking at our own culture and the scientific knowledge that we have. With today&#x27;s world, I may not be using any of ancient Vedas but I am and will be very proud of it and that, will give me an inner strength. In this Spirit it should be taken. </p>

        <p class="h4-d-interview">8. Please. Tell us more about the Sopan Ashram initiative.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p class="body-d-interview">The Sopan ashram initiative was started in 2001, but its seed started in 2001 itself. When I joined IIT Kanpur in 1994 as a faculty member, I was given first-year classes. People who have cleared IIT-JEE and allied examinations got admitted to IIT Kanpur. I found that something is greatly missing in our school system because, the students who are supposed to be the cream of society, went through all kinds of torture during their preparation for it, finally passed and landed up in such prestigious institution like IIT Kanpur. Still, they didn&#x27;t even have Basic training in analysing the thing, understanding it well, and coming out with the applications? They were not able to think. Somewhere our school system is not doing its job. They are only preparing the students for exams, which is of no use. We have to prepare students because they have to develop skills. Analysis is one great comprehension; it is a skill one must acquire. And then coming out with your own paths and ideas and on the structures is another these are the things that should be there. But these were absolutely lacking. So, from there, this idea triggered that we should we should have a centre. Of course, it&#x27;s for my own satisfaction. I don&#x27;t say that it&#x27;ll transform society. Let us have a center where science is not taught, but science is just lived. So for those connections, if we can do that and the students are or all students are very good. All students are very capable. It only matters that who excels and who doesn&#x27;t Excel but the potential is very much there. So the whole idea was that if we can have such a center and the students come here and feel the science get attached to it and then we connect it to the theories and equations and textbook stuff with that, it will be much more complete. Dealing with the equations, they learn all those definitions, they come to practice that mathematics. Everything is there, but if they didn&#x27;t know that yes, it happens like that, whatever the equation is telling it happens on the table ,the connections and everything will start working. So that idea came after I started teaching the first year and realized that these so-called JEE toppers do not have anything special. So that is how this idea came in 2003. We started working with teachers, we decided to focus on teachers more, the students will also be there but that will not be our main focus. So that teachers can enjoy teaching, feel their subject, and start loving their subject. The things that are written in that textbook are to be just crammed. I always say that cramming is Good, I mean it&#x27;s not a bad thing. But just cramming is not good. So our teachers should realize that this is the real-life description that we are doing in the physics textbooks. And if they realize this, the delivery will automatically be very different. In 2003 we had our first teacher&#x27;s workshop at Kanpur club. So our teammates booked that club for an afternoon and then with some 30 40 teachers of Kanpur we showed some 7-8 concepts with experiments. Concepts which are there in the textbook. We showed the corresponding experiments and, it was a big hit. The first Workshop itself was a big hit. We were encouraged and then gradually we expanded things. I retired in 2017. I wanted to have a center of my own in which I could do orient teachers and students full time toward real science. So that is how it started. And now it has a many dimensions. You may visit our website shikshasopan.org which gives all these details. We are working with teachers, students of classes from class 6 to the research level. We have something for everyone. We have something for everyone. Our degree college students from kanpur doing MS or BSC, for them we have a research-level laboratory, which we call students research exposure lab and Some students come here and do their research work and submit their MSC dissertation, which is in general just a formality. The students who happened to come to us did real research and real learning and last year some Final year students were here. They submitted their MSC dissertation in the true Spirit of it. Although Kanpur University never demands that. Whatever you write it&#x27;s accepted. But all these five people after doing MSC are already in some research institutions. Already in some research students. So we are very happy that our lab is productive in this area also and since it is a research lab, we do not have a predefined syllabus or material. Students explore and we put up new facilities, we fabricate. We have some facilities for Publications as well. We had several sessions for the kg, class 1 students also at our place. They also get to learn what science is. From class six on-words, of course, we have more structured program. We have bus facility from different schools, almost 40-50 students will be here for about four-five hours and then Look at all the things we have. I will not say they learn science, but that will they learn to appreciate science. We have classes till Batchelor level. So that kind of things we have developed and I invite you to visit our place. We have little bit of Agriculture as well, we have fruit trees, vegetables, mustard and many more we grow here. We have cows who give pure milk of cows when available. We also have solar panels to generate energy. We want to show that science is very much there in at every step. We had one workshop of physics teachers and the title was solving JEE Advanced question paper with school physics teachers and let me tell you, the program was absolutely surprising. These teachers never looked at Jee paper earlier. They are not doing any tuitions. They are regular school teachers. Some from private colleges from some from government colleges. And people were astonished to see that Jee papers are so simple. We actually took up, 2023 22 21 and 20 Advanced questions and we have recorded everything that I will be putting it online soon. And a lot many more things we are doing at shiksha sopan ashram. </p>

      <div class="left">
        <p class="h4-d-interview">9. Being a student, teacher and an author. There is some stress and anxiety while working. So how do you deal with that? What solution would you like to give to youngsters?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p class="body-d-interview">The same thing as I told you earlier you cannot control the future. So, no question of taking stress. The nature will take its course. Okay, you can plan and you can work according to the plan but you still know that there&#x27;s a lot of uncertainty, and therefore nothing to be worried about. You have confidence that everything will go well. It can go. Or, it may not go. Its fine. But we take the decision today that yes, every Theory every section every chapter starts with some kind of assumptions. And then the theory is built on and those assumptions assuming those things to be true. The theory is built the equations are built. Let us not take this as an algorithm that everything in future will always be good. So, there&#x27;s no question for worrying about the future and we should enjoy learning. We must be honest with our learning we put up our minds. There should be a constant search for new ideas. One should look for his own abilities, to improve and don&#x27;t worry much about the marks. Once you are free of that marks syndrome and you focus on your own skill development, then everything is good. Nothing goes drastically wrong there. Of course, the future is always uncertain, but then you are capable of doing wonderful things. But if the skill is not acquired, then this grade cards are not going to help. If you started to rely on these, you cannot Excel. You can only be an average. This was my thinking from the very beginning and that is why I was never worried about the future. Do stressless learning, be happy that we are very fortunate. This planet is very unique and then being humans on this planet, we really have all the required skills, its already there in us! We just have to start believing in ourselves. Let us believe in ourselves and we can do it, we will do it. And if you have some kind of social band that we have to do something for the society at all. You will be stress free. </p>

    <div class="interview-content">
      <div class="left">
        <p class="h4-d-interview">10. Every year we decide a theme for the magazine and this time we decided “Advaith” as we say in Sanskrit which means non-duality as our theme. So, the question was how what do you think about the uniqueness of every element which existing universe?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p class="body-d-interview">Yeah, see uniqueness is very much there. Okay, but then the cooperation is also there. Every element in the periodic table has a definite, distinct, unique atomic number Z. But when the same element is combined to make a solid, the things are very different. The properties of an atom, properties of a solid containing the same atoms is drastically different. So cooperation brings the uniqueness in a person which is just wonderfull. So, Duality is in the sense that yes, everyone is unique, every human is unique, every insect is unique, every plant is unique. But then all these unique things are not in isolation. They cooperate with each other combine with each other and collectively they give us a lot of strength. Therefore, both things are to be taken into account, the uniqueness, as well as the collectiveness. </p>

    <div class="interview-content">
      <div class="left">
        <p class="h4-d-interview">11. Other than toppers there are people with average marks who score average or like whose performance is always average. So how do you treat those students as a teacher? How do you treat those students or what is your approach towards them?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p class="body-d-interview">See first thing is that all humans have lots of capabilities. There is only an infinitesimal difference in the topper and in the average and the lowest scoring. But what we do is just like on your mobile, you put two fingers and take them apart from each other and zoom the thing. Similarly it has been zoomed into a very big number. And then you have a clear Division &quot;This is a topper and this is the failure and this is the average&quot; They said that intrinsically if you are healthy means your physical health, mental health is okay, then your mind is sound and you can sleep well, having a smiling face in all situations. So if you can manage that, then intrinsically every student is unique and has excellent capabilities. These grades are not at all a measurement of your inherent capabilities. In fact in my middle school and high school, I wasn’t even a average student. But then In my MSC, I was at the top of the IIT Kanpur batch. So even if you don&#x27;t perform in the examination, this is not a thing to be worried about. You are the best. Believe in yourself. So how do I handle my class as a teacher if it is so heterogeneous? Is very simple. I practice it when I prepare for my lecture. I have three varieties of time slots. The first time slot is for the whole class. I want to teach the entire class a certain thing. I want to make an entire class feel something. To see something and to enjoy something as the whole class. The second slot is for 5 to 10 minutes, dedicated to the students who are so-called in the top category who prepared well they practiced enough, are good in mathematics and good in grasping the concepts. They already have studied the chapters at their home. So the so-called bright students were I have just five to seven minutes, Specifically designed question are given. Since the whole class will not understand what I&#x27;m talking, I will be throwing a challenge to those Toppers that you go home and Ponder on this. So, it&#x27;s a puzzle for them. And then five to seven minutes is for the last benchers. That time I will be focusing on them. I give them a take-home message that I learned this in the class. It will be perhaps a waste of time. But doesn&#x27;t matter it is a 50-minute period nothing wrong investing 5 to 7 minutes. So the Mantra is as a teacher, each one of my students should go out of my class with what I have learned this thing today. And if you have this feeling I have learned this thing today, immediately your inner potentials come up. And then in the next class you do much better. So that is how I deal with this situation. </p>

      <div class="right">
        <p class="body-d-interview">I&#x27;ll just repeat what I said, &quot;Believe in yourself&quot;. All the students have the inherent potential to excel. Inherent potential to excel by putting stress on your mind don&#x27;t kill that. Utilize your time well and just enjoy your studies. Come up with more innovative ideas and you debate you do shastrath. Don’t budge on your opinion until someone convenes you. Listen to everyone honestly and then counter. You are the best.</p>
