        <p class="paragraph-12">The annual college magazine 'Catalyst' is a product of the innovative minds of four individuals. What began in 2016 as a tentative venture has now stood the test of time, entering its 7th year of production. Initially, the creators did not anticipate the legacy it would build, but it quickly internalized the excitement surrounding it.
<br><br>
          In 2017, we adopted the theme 'Make in India' to promote future entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship, which saw significant participation from the students. The following year, the theme 'WHY?' resonated with the college's sentiments at the time, receiving phenomenal feedback due to its organic and homegrown nature. With the theme 'I to We', the magazine highlighted a larger purpose of human life.
          <br><br>
          Last year, with 'Panorama', we aimed to broaden our horizons and break free from self-imposed limitations, embracing the world's vastness and complexity. This theme emphasized the transformative power of art and the importance of changing our perspective if we cannot change our circumstances.
          <br><br>
          This year, our theme is 'Advait', which signifies oneness and non-duality. It encourages us to see beyond the illusion of separateness and recognize the interconnectedness of all things. Through this theme, we hope to inspire a deeper understanding of unity and the essence of our shared existence. The magazine will feature articles, stories, and artworks that explore the concept of oneness, illustrating how despite our diverse backgrounds and perspectives, we are all part of a singular reality. By embracing 'Advait', we aim to foster a sense of harmony and collective consciousness within our college community.<br><br>

          Advait!

The whole journey felt like that of a river flowing in the mountains—the highs and the lows, and sometimes meandering decisions before we all landed to something final.

          As I write this editor’s note we are filled with immense gratitude to Dr. Chitra Gaikwad ma'am, without her this magazine would not come to fruition. To all the members of team Catalyst for making this magazine a reality, and for working exceptionally hard to leave no stone unturned in producing our best work and upholding the legacy of Catalyst.<br><br>
          I thank all of you, I, as the Team Head feel immensely proud of my team. Designing Web copy as well as hard copy side by side, wasn't an easy but we as a team worked day & night ignoring all the external noises, and handling the pressure to bring you this unique collection of philosophy, art, memories and talent. Whole journey in Catalyst was memorable, I'll always cherish these moments of my life and wish you all live through such beautiful moments too..

        <p class="paragraph-12">Dear Students, Faculty, Alumni, and Esteemed Readers,<br>
          It is with great pride and joy that I address you through the annual edition of our college magazine, "Advait." This publication by our passionate Team Catalyst not only serves as a chronicle of the myriad achievements and activities of our institution but also stands as a testament to the remarkable talent and dedication that permeates the corridors of Government College of Engineering, Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar (Aurangabad).
          This past year has been a phenomenal one for our students, who have continued to excel in both academic and extracurricular arenas. Our engineering students have demonstrated exemplary performance in various competitive examinations, including GATE and campus placement drives, securing positions in prestigious organizations and institutions worldwide. Their relentless pursuit of knowledge and excellence has brought accolades to our college, establishing it as a beacon of engineering education in India.<br></p>
          <div class="w-layout-grid anunual-festphoto"><img sizes="(max-width: 479px) 83vw, 350px" alt="" src="images/principle.jpg" loading="lazy" class="image-102" style="border-radius: 10%;"></div>
          <p class="paragraph-12">
          What truly sets our students apart is their unique blend of technical skills and creative talents. Beyond the realm of engineering, our students have excelled in arts, sports, and cultural activities, showcasing a versatility that is truly commendable. Just like this very state-of-the-art magazine, “Advait” infused with emotions of words, lively rhymes, artistic work of colours and some captured moments. I appreciate the hard work and commitment of Team Catalyst that made it possible to include the interviews of luminary personalities such as Dr. Bhalchandra Nemade a notable author of various best sellers from more than five decades, Dr. Vijay Bhatkar the father of Indian Supercomputer and a great computer scientist and Dr. HC Verma the professor who revolutionized the way of studying Physics by simplifying its concepts. Also during this tenure the institute got privilege to host some of the renowned dignitaries such as police inspector Praveena Yadav on occasion of International Women's Day, Dr. Arun Wahul on Babasaheb Ambedkar Jayanti, Shikhar Goel and Hrishikesh Ranade during WINGS and Antarang respectively, Mr. Shashank Jewlikar on occasion of engineers day and Mr Shivprasad Jaju for an expert talk<br><br>
          Moreover, our students have showcased their prowess in national and international technical competitions, hackathons, and innovation challenges. Teams from our college have won top honours in events like Smart India Hackathon, Baja SAE, and various robotics competitions, illustrating their innovative spirit and technical expertise. Their achievements are a source of immense pride and inspiration for us all. Our college's sports teams have also brought laurels by winning inter-college tournaments and participating in state and national level competitions. These achievements highlight the importance we place on holistic development, ensuring our students are well-rounded individuals ready to face the challenges of the future.<br><br>
          As we reflect on the accomplishments of the past year, we also look forward to the future with renewed optimism and determination. The launch of new academic programs, more technically inclined courses, and industry partnerships will further enhance our educational offerings. Our goal is to continue nurturing the next generation of engineers who are not only technically proficient but also socially responsible and innovative thinkers.
          In conclusion, "Advait" is more than just a magazine; it is a celebration of our collective unique journey, filled with stories of hard work, perseverance, and success. I extend my heartfelt congratulations to Team Catalyst and its editor for their efforts in bringing this publication to life. Let us continue to strive for excellence and uphold the values that make our college a distinguished institution.
          With warm regards,<br><br>
