            <h1 class="h2-d">PEOPLE ARE NOT FOR RELIGION</h1>
            <p class="article-para">  I find the ideas and concepts presented by Rajneesh very suitable and logically sound. The  explanation of God cannot be entirely logical, as God and logic are inherently contradictory. However,  the non-existence of God and its correlation with logic can be well established, as it makes complete  sense. When a child is in trouble, they instinctively seek their mother for care and support. This  creates a sense of being backed up, and from this simple idea, the concept of God evolves hand in  hand. Let me delve into Rajneesh&#x27;s discussions for further clarification and with him I too say that:  “God is the greatest lie invented by a man because man feels so helpless, so afraid of death, so  burdened with life&#x27;s problems, and because he has been raised by a father and by a mother, and  those were the beautiful days - no responsibility, no worries; somebody was taking care of him/her.  That psychological childhood is projected into all religions: God becomes the father, and there are  few religions in which God becomes the mother. It is a simple psychological projection of a child; it  has no basis in reality. And whenever you are afraid, and when you are in trouble, you start seeking  help. But no help ever comes. Even Jesus on the cross was waiting for help to come and finally got  disappointed and shouted, &quot;Father, have you forsaken me?&quot; A great doubt must have arisen in him, a  great question - nothing is happening. And he was believing all these years that God would come to  save him, his son, but nobody came. Jesus Christ must have died in utter disillusionment. I don’t have  any illusion; I cannot be disillusioned. I do not believe God does not exist; I know for sure he does not exist. And thank God that he does  not exist, because the existence of God would have created so many problems, difficulties that life  would have been almost impossible. You may not have looked at it from this angle, from which I am  going to talk with you. Perhaps nobody has ever tried to look at it from this angle. The Christians say  God created the world. In fact, the hypothesis of God is needed for the creation; the world is there,  somebody must have created it. Whoever created it, the creator is God. But do you see the  implication? If the world is created, then there can be no evolution. Evolution means that creation  continues. Think of the Christian story: God created the world in six days, and then on the seventh  day, he rested. Since then, he has been resting. The whole creation was completed in six days. Now,  from where can evolution have possibilities? Creation means finished; the full stop has arrived on the  sixth day - the full stop. And after that, there is no possibility of creation. Evolution implies that  creation is not complete; hence the possibility of evolving. But God cannot create an incomplete  world; that would be going against God&#x27;s nature. He is perfect, and whatsoever he does is perfect.  Neither is he evolving, nor is the world evolving; everything is at a standstill. Death. This is the reason  why popes were against Darwin - that man was bringing ideas which were in contradiction. They  could see the far-reaching implication of the idea of evolution. Ordinarily, you would not connect  creation and evolution. What connection is there for God and Darwin? There is a connection. Charles  Darwin is that the creation is an ongoing process; that existence is always imperfect, is never going to  be perfect. Only then will it be evolving, reaching new peaks and dimensions, new possibilities. God  had finished his work in six days, and not long ago, four thousand and four years before Jesus Christ  was born. It must have been the first of January, Monday, because we manage to fit God into  everything that we have created; he has to follow our calendar. If you ask me, it must have been  Monday, the first of April, the Fool&#x27;s Day, because that day seems to be absolutely suitable for doing  such an act of creating a complete, ready-made existence.” Some religions believe in the existence of God, while others do not. So, what&#x27;s the deal with religion,  you may ask? Isn&#x27;t religion connected to God? No, counter. Instead, I propose the larger question: Is  religion not for people? I say and quote that religion is for people; people are not for religion. I find it  absolutely ridiculous and utterly absurd that people fight over some imaginary concept for which  they are not even sure. A person born in India has a good chance of being Hindu, while in Italy,  Christianity prevails. In fact, religion binds people; it makes them sane and encourages them to do  good tasks. Religion, in essence, serves to unite people, fostering sanity and inspiring altruistic deeds. But when it reaches an extreme level, we must recognize there are some problems because religion  is not the ultimate truth; it is we who make it the truth and give meaning to it. Then, what is the  ultimate religion, you may ask? And I find it very simple to answer and very obvious: HUMANITY. It is  the only religion I perceive to be above all other man-made religions because man cannot make  humanity; humanity exists as man exists. People may create new religions and assign gods and  goddesses, but humanity can&#x27;t be created; it is the only religion which, in fact, aligns with the  concept of religion. <br><br>- Vivek Lankeshwar<br></p>
