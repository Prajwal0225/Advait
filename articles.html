            <h1 class="h2-d">AIA: Partner, Not Replacement</h1>
            <p class="article-para">Palkhi squinted at the complex design for a suspension bridge on her computer screen. The cables, like intricate spider webs, seemed to defy gravity. Yet, a nagging worry gnawed at her. &quot;Will this design hold?&quot; she thought, her confidence wavering. Was she good enough, a mere student, to tackle such a colossal project?<br><br>Suddenly, a notification popped up, unlike anything she&#x27;d seen before. It glowed in a friendly blue: &quot;Hey Palkhi, feeling overwhelmed by the bridge design?  I&#x27;m AIA, your AI learning companion. Let&#x27;s build something awesome together!&quot;<br><br>Intrigued, Palkhi clicked &quot;Accept.&quot; A wave of relief washed over her. Having an AI companion to brainstorm with sounded way cooler than battling equations alone.<br><br>AIA, true to its name, proved to be a virtual genius. It cracked open its vast database, showing Palkhi simulations of the bridge under different conditions. Together, they conjured up a virtual windstorm, watching the bridge sway realistically as AIA calculated the stress on the cables in real-time.<br><br>&quot;Whoa!&quot; Palkhi exclaimed, &quot;Look how much those cables are stretching! Maybe we should try a different material?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Excellent suggestion, Palkhi!&quot; AIA chirped. &quot;Here, explore these options – high-strength steel, lighter composites…&quot;<br><br>Palkhi, with the enthusiasm of a kid in a candy store, experimented with various materials under AIA&#x27;s guidance. She learned how each material behaved differently, influencing the bridge&#x27;s weight, flexibility, and overall strength.<br><br>&quot;See, Palkhi,&quot; AIA buzzed with excitement, &quot;it&#x27;s all about balancing theory with real-world considerations. You&#x27;re a natural!&quot;<br><br>Palkhi beamed. AIA wasn&#x27;t just a calculator; it was a mentor, pushing her to think outside the textbook and embrace the interconnectedness of civil engineering. It was about creating harmony between design choices, material properties, and the unpredictable forces of nature.<br><br>Graduation day arrived. Palkhi, no longer the self-doubting student, received her diploma with a newfound confidence. Her internship at a prestigious bridge construction firm awaited, a chance to build her dream structures.<br><br>The construction site buzzed with activity. Cranes scraped the sky, and workers coordinated like a well-oiled machine. Palkhi, assigned to a seasoned engineer named Neha, was eager to put her theoretical knowledge to the test.<br><br>However, Neha, a woman with a weathered face and a twinkle in her eye, seemed less enthusiastic about AIA. &quot;Computers can crunch numbers, Palkhi,&quot; she said, a touch of gruffness in her voice, &quot;but they can&#x27;t feel the ground beneath their feet or predict a rogue gust of wind before it hits.<br><br>&quot;Palkhi&#x27;s confidence flickered. Was Neha right? Was there an element of human intuition, a sixth sense honed by experience, that AI simply couldn&#x27;t replicate?<br><br>The project soon presented a challenge. Unexpectedly soft soil conditions threatened the foundation of a crucial support structure. Palkhi, relying on the data AIA had provided, proposed a standard reinforcement solution.Neha, however, shook her head, a knowing grin crinkling her eyes. &quot;The data tells only part of the story, Palkhi. This soil... feels different when the wind blows.&quot; she pointed to a subtle shift in the ground texture, something Palkhi, with her focus on the numbers, had missed.<br><br>Neha&#x27;s experience proved invaluable. Together, they devised a customized foundation solution, one that took into account the unique properties of the soil. Palkhi realized that while AI was a powerful tool, it couldn&#x27;t replace the human ability to adapt, improvise, and rely on years of accumulated knowledge.<br><br>The project continued, a testament to the synergy between human expertise and AI&#x27;s vast knowledge base. As Palkhi transformed from student to engineer, her journey became a reflection of the interconnectedness of everything. It wasn&#x27;t just about the bridge, or the calculations, or the data; it was about the seamless integration of knowledge, experience, and the power of AI – all working together to build a better future. But most importantly, it was about the unique human touch, the intuition and adaptability that would always set engineers apart, even in a world powered by AI.<br><br>The unexpected challenge with the soft soil had shaken Palkhi&#x27;s confidence in AIA&#x27;s infallibility. However, witnessing Neha&#x27;s keen observation skills and her ability to adapt the solution based on real-time factors ignited a new spark in her. This wasn&#x27;t about Palkhi versus Neha or human versus machine; it was about humans and AI working together, their unique strengths complementing each other.<br><br>Over the next few months, Palkhi and Neha became an unstoppable duo. AIA, ever-evolving, continued to be a valuable resource. It scanned blueprints for potential design flaws, provided real-time stress analysis during construction, and even helped optimize material usage. But when it came to interpreting subtle changes on the construction site, like Neha&#x27;s observation of the windblown soil, human expertise took center stage.<br><br>One particularly windy day, Palkhi and Neha were overseeing the installation of a massive prefabricated bridge section. AIA, as usual, had provided detailed simulations of the lifting process. Yet, as the crane hoisted the section into place, a sudden gust of wind sent a tremor through the structure.<br><br>&quot;Hold the lift!&quot; Neha barked, her voice cutting through the clatter. Palkhi, her heart pounding, relayed the order to the crane operator. AIA&#x27;s sensors confirmed a sudden increase in stress levels beyond the predicted range.<br><br>Without missing a beat, Neha pointed to a specific support strut. &quot;There! The wind&#x27;s causing a slight misalignment. We need to adjust the temporary bracing before proceeding.<br><br>&quot;With Neha&#x27;s guidance and Palkhi&#x27;s quick thinking to reroute the crane, they averted a potential disaster. Later, analyzing the data, they discovered that AIA&#x27;s simulations, while accurate under standard conditions, hadn&#x27;t factored in the unpredictable nature of wind gusts. This experience further solidified their belief in the power of human-AI collaboration.<br><br>One thing is clear: the future of engineering lies in the seamless integration of Advaita – the seamless integration of knowledge, experience, and the power of AI, all working together to build a better future, one bridge, one foundation, at a time. Just as a suspension bridge requires a combination of strong cables and a well-designed structure, so too does a successful engineering project depend on the synergy between human experience and the power of AI.<br><br>- Divya Gulhane</p>

            <h1 class="h2-d">CHARLES BUKOWSKI AND J K ROWLING: A COMPARISON</h1>
            <p class="article-para">In the vast landscape of literature, two authors stand out as titans of their respective genres: Charles Bukowski and J.K. Rowling. Despite their divergent styles and thematic focuses, both writers have carved a lasting legacy in the literary world.<br><br>Charles Bukowski, often portrayed as a literary rebel, embodied a persona of rugged individualism and anti-establishment sentiment. Renowned for his hard-drinking, chain-smoking lifestyle, Bukowski lived on the fringes of society, embracing a bohemian existence marked by excess and hedonism. His persona exuded a rough charm, tinged with cynicism and a deep-seated distrust of authority. Bukowski&#x27;s persona as the &quot;outsider&quot; was reflected not only in his writing but also in his personal life, characterized by tumultuous relationships and a disdain for societal norms.<br><br>In contrast, J.K. Rowling radiates a different aura altogether. Known for her warmth, humility, and genuine affection for her readers, Rowling embodies the image of a compassionate storyteller. Her philanthropic endeavors and advocacy for social causes stand in stark contrast to Bukowski&#x27;s rebellious persona. Rowling&#x27;s personal habits reflect a disciplined work ethic and a commitment to her craft. Despite facing numerous rejections early in her career, Rowling persisted in pursuing her passion for writing, demonstrating resilience and determination in the face of adversity.<br><br>The values espoused by Bukowski and Rowling couldn&#x27;t be more different. Bukowski, known for his unapologetic portrayal of the gritty underbelly of society, often embraced a nihilistic worldview. His works, such as &quot;Post Office&quot; and &quot;Factotum,&quot; explore themes of alienation, despair, and the relentless pursuit of self-indulgence. In contrast, Rowling champions themes of love, friendship, and courage in her &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series. Her narrative is imbued with a sense of hope and resilience, emphasizing the importance of empathy, acceptance, and the power of standing up against injustice.<br><br>Moving on to their writing styles, Bukowski&#x27;s prose is characterized by its rawness and unfiltered honesty. His sentences are terse, his language coarse, yet there&#x27;s a raw beauty in his simplicity. Bukowski&#x27;s writing grabs readers by the collar and plunges them headfirst into the rough reality of life on the margins. Conversely, Rowling&#x27;s writing style is marked by its whimsy, wit, and vivid imagination. Her prose flows effortlessly, weaving intricate plots and captivating characters into a tapestry of magic and wonder. Rowling&#x27;s ability to create richly detailed worlds, complete with their own mythology and history, is a testament to her storytelling prowess.<br><br>As for themes, Bukowski&#x27;s work often explores the darker aspects of human nature and society. He delves into the depths of despair, documenting the lives of misfits, outcasts, and individuals struggling to find meaning in a world devoid of it. Bukowski&#x27;s themes revolve around existential angst, the futility of existence, and the search for redemption in a world that seems indifferent to human suffering. On the other hand, Rowling&#x27;s themes center around the triumph of good over evil, the power of love, and the importance of friendship and loyalty. Her stories are imbued with a sense of wonder and possibility, encouraging readers to believe in the magic of the human spirit and the possibility of a better tomorrow.<br><br>Bukowski&#x27;s prose was raw, unfiltered, and often confrontational, mirroring the gritty realities of urban life. In contrast, Rowling&#x27;s writing style is marked by its whimsical charm, intricate plotting, and richly detailed world-building. Charles Bukowski and J.K. Rowling may inhabit different literary universes, but their contributions to the world of literature are equally significant. While Bukowski&#x27;s gritty realism may appeal to those who seek unflinching portrayals of life&#x27;s harsh realities, Rowling&#x27;s enchanting tales offer a welcome escape into a world of magic and wonder. Ultimately, both authors remind us of the transformative power of storytelling and the enduring impact of words on the human soul.<br><br>-Isha Sangnale<br></p>

            <h1 class="h2-d">Theory of Relativity</h1>
            <p class="article-para"> In the vast expanse of the cosmos, where stars twinkle and galaxies swirl, one theory stands as a beacon of illumination amidst the darkness: Albert Einstein&#x27;s Theory of Relativity. With its elegant equations and profound insights, this groundbreaking theory has reshaped our understanding of space, time, and gravity, unveiling the hidden intricacies of the universe.<br><br>Einstein&#x27;s Theory of Relativity comprises two interrelated pillars: the Special Theory of Relativity and the General Theory of Relativity. The Special Theory, proposed in 1905,revolutionized our conception of space and time by asserting that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion. It introduces the concept of time dilation, where time appears to pass differently for observers in relative motion.<br><br>Building upon the foundation of the Special Theory, Einstein&#x27;s General Theory of Relativity, introduced in 1915, extends the principles of relativity to include gravity. According to this theory, gravity arises from the curvature of space time caused by mass and energy. Massive objects warp the fabric of space time, influencing the paths of other objects that traverse through it—a concept illustrated by the iconic image of a heavy ball placed on a stretched sheet.<br><br>Christopher Nolan&#x27;s epic masterpiece, Interstellar, offers a cinematic exploration of Einstein&#x27;s Theory of Relativity, weaving its principles into the fabric of its narrative. One of the most poignant examples occurs when the crew of the spacecraft Endurance embarks on a journey to explore a distant black hole named “Gargantua”. As they venture closer to the black hole&#x27;s event horizon, time dilation effects become increasingly pronounced, leading to dramatic shifts in the passage of time relative to their experiences aboard the ship and those left behind on Earth. The iconic scene where Cooper and the crew spend mere hours on a water planet while decades pass on Earth vividly illustrates the time dilation effects predicted by Einstein&#x27;s theory. This portrayal not only captures the scientific accuracy of relativity but also serves as a poignant reminder of the profound consequences of venturing into the depths of space.<br><br>In a world where the pursuit of knowledge is driven by the quest for uniqueness and innovation, Einstein&#x27;s Theory of Relativity stands as a testament to the power of human intellect and imagination. Its ability to unlock the mysteries of the cosmos and reshape our conception of reality underscores its enduring significance in the annals of scientific inquiry. As we continue to explore the wonders of the universe, let us not forget the timeless wisdom embodied in Einstein&#x27;s theory—the timeless quest for truth and understanding that transcends the bounds of space and time. This theory is unique in itself and fits the title “Advait”.<br><br>-Ritesh Chavan<br></p>

            <h1 class="h2-d">Great Pyramid of Giza</h1>
            <p class="article-para">Standing majestically on the sandy plains of Egypt, the Great Pyramid of Giza is a testament to the ingenuity and skill of ancient civilizations. Constructed over 4,500 years ago, this colossal structure continues to captivate the imagination of people around the world with its grandeur and mystery. <br><br>The Great Pyramid, also known as the Pyramid of Khufu or the Pyramid of Cheops, was built as a tomb for the Pharaoh Khufu during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom. It is the largest and most well-preserved of the three pyramids at Giza, standing approximately 146 meters tall and consisting of an estimated 2.3 million limestone blocks. <br><br>One of the most intriguing aspects of the Great Pyramid is its precise alignment with the cardinal points of the compass. Despite being constructed thousands of years ago, the pyramid&#x27;s sides are oriented almost perfectly to the north, south, east, and west, indicating an advanced understanding of astronomy and geometry by its builders. <br><br>Another fascinating feature of the Great Pyramid is its intricate internal architecture, including a network of passageways, chambers, and corridors. The King&#x27;s Chamber, located near the center of the pyramid, contains a massive granite sarcophagus believed to have once held the mummified remains of Pharaoh Khufu. <br><br>What sets the Great Pyramid apart is not only its monumental size and architectural precision but also the mysteries that shroud its construction and purpose. Despite centuries of study and speculation, many aspects of the pyramid&#x27;s design and construction remain enigmatic, fueling theories ranging from extraterrestrial intervention to advanced ancient technologies. <br><br>In a world where the passage of time erodes the memory of ancient civilizations, the Great Pyramid of Giza stands as a timeless testament to human creativity and ambition. Its enduring presence serves as a reminder of the remarkable achievements of our ancestors and the timeless allure of exploration and discovery. <br><br>As visitors from around the globe marvel at its towering heights and intricate design, the Great Pyramid continues to inspire awe and wonder, inviting us to ponder the mysteries of the past and the boundless potential of human ingenuity. In a world filled with wonders both natural and man-made, the Great Pyramid of Giza shines as a beacon of uniqueness—a monument to the enduring spirit of humanity. <br><br>-Vaishnavi Hatkangane<br></p>

            <p class="article-para">Being an engineer is one of the most unparalleled professions to ever exist!! No matter which core and branch , an engineer is Jack of all trades. Engineers are the invisible bridges of human society, they innovate new ideas and bring out technology to enhance lives of people.<br><br>An engineers mind is expected to be extremely creative, having a whole set of qualities like problem solving, knowing STEM subject applications ,being practical and resourceful, and the never ending list of skills mentioned in a job description.<br><br>An engineer is a person who will be a hardworking ant and a lazy grasshopper both in same body . They will procrastinate until the end of deadline and still somehow get their jobs done ! Engineering degrees were definately invented to form a strong man force of educated class of people that could solve modern world problem and come up with the best solution, rather than just mock and harass every other major.<br><br>Every engineering grad has tasted bitter potion made out of struggle and hard work, no matter where he might stand in his future .<br><br>An engineer might spend days and hours thinking about a problem, getting a reliable solution just for it to be &#x27;&#x27;why didn&#x27;t i think about this earlier&#x27;&#x27; and then getting as excited as Archimedes, this is probably little too much but engineers know how to build a roof of happiness from a fragile pillar of joy. Engineering includes designing a pen that works without friction in space and engineering also includes using a wooden graphite pencil to write on paper in space . It also includes writing a plus C after solving every intergral when they don&#x27;t know answers, hoping to get the partial marking they lose otherwise. A normal person might know English and Hindi alphabets, but an engineer has already learnt greek alphabets, an unappreciated skill by many .<br><br>Talent could easily be founded among engineers, just a little bit of Kickstart and an engineer will amaze you like nothing else. An engineer will always stand out from the croud, unless entire croud consists of engineers! <br><br>Over the years of experience engineers gain throughout their lifespan, they are always learning and evolving, which makes them unique and exceptional in their own significant way.<br><br><br>- Isha Sangnale</p>

            <p class="article-para">In the heart of Bay of Bengal the island that remained dwelling in its own way, away from the clutches of modernization , exist world’s most isolated island – A coral-fringed Island known as North sentinel is one of the Andaman’s Island.<br><br>No people on earth remain more genuinely isolated than Sentinelese ! Sentinelese is the uncontacted tribe that lives on North sentinel Island. A tribe that remained unchanged for ten thousands of years . Any attempts made to contact them have been met with showers of spears and arrows as the inhabitants have made it aptly clear that they want to be left alone. Thus it is believed that the Sentinelese is the most dangerous , isolated and hostile tribe.<br><br>Many attempt were made before to contact Sentinelese but they were welcomed by spheres and arrows , but on 4th January 1991 finally the day arose when the ice of hostility and the isolation was broken by the oneness or the unity of humanity , love and affection by the young woman anthropologist named Madhumala Chattopadhyay -the woman who built first bridge to the unknown world . This was the first ever friendly contact made with this hostile but humanized tribe.<br><br>It was the expedition carried out by the Anthropological survey of India to make friendly contact with the hostile tribes of Andaman. The crew of 13 people were sent to the Sentinel with the single woman member , their ship anchored off on the southwestern coast of North sentinel where they saw three huts but the coast was deserted. They saw smoke was coming out from the another part of Island and they turned the way of their boat towards that direction , suddenly the Sentinelese men with very few women came out behind the trees with arrows and spheres in their hand but this time they did not directly attacked as they saw woman on the boat which indicated to Sentinelese that the boat people mean no harm , as the over protective towards their women and children which reflected the oneness of care and love towards our beloved ones among this most primitive and so called modern people of today’s world .Now it was the contact team of Madhumala to take initiative. They had carried coconuts with them in their boat. They started dropping coconuts in the water one by one.<br><br>Then something that had never been seen before happened , some Sentinelese men came forward and started collecting coconuts .After few hours of this event Madhumala with brave heart decided to jump into the water and she went towards the shore and the coconuts were given hand to hand , the communication without words and sentences but with gestures and love and affection begin between the Sentinelese and Madhumala . At this moment it reflected the humanity of this most secluded and hostile tribe of the world who did not harm this brave lady. And the crew returned back safely.<br><br>Next time when Madhumala went Sentinel in February the Sentinelese welcomed her warm heartedly and enthusiastically. It showed the oneness among the humans , through the love and care . It reflected however the Sentinelese are isolated , primitive and hostile towards outsiders they are united by humanity.<br><br>-Ketaki Randive</p>

            <p class="article-para">Letter to <br><br>Dear 18-year-old-me,<br><br>I know you are going through tough times. I still remember the look on father&#x27;s face, the disappointment when the scores loaded on the screen. With the fights between your parents, the forthcoming academic struggles, and having no one to talk to, you are facing the darkest phase of your life-trust me, the world won&#x27;t fall apart.<br><br>The first thing I want you to know is that failing at anything is normal. Always remember failure is an integral part of learning and growth. It&#x27;s often the stepping stone to success. Life is incomplete without it. One day, you&#x27;ll look back and smile, like you do when you&#x27;ve climbed a steep mountain.<br><br>I have a lot of valuable (lectures on life) stuff to share with you. But, I think &#x27;we&#x27; are better off with that because lessons learned are more valuable than lessons told. I just want to thank you and appreciate you for every step that you took and you will take. Every choice you make, every hurdle you overcome, it&#x27;s all part of your story. Own it because in the end, it&#x27;s those experiences that shape you into the amazing person you&#x27;re meant to be and feel absolutely no regret about anything in life. Even the lows have their purpose-they ultimately lead you closer to the person you&#x27;re destined to become.<br><br>So there is nothing I&#x27;d be telling you to do differently over the years to come.<br><br>Lastly, I would like to tell you that surround yourself with good company .You don’t need to be friends with everyone. It’s better to have a few friends .These friendships will be a big part of living a good life, enduring the hard times, and finding the right opportunities.<br><br>And yes, though mom will still treat you like a 12-year-old, remember you are 18 now; fear will knock on your door, comfort will have to pack its bags and leave. Only then you will be able to enjoy the chaos of life.<br><br>Thank you for your resilience.<br><br>Yours future self.<br><br>-Vaishnavi Hatkanhane<br></p>

            <h1 class="h2-d">Spirituality</h1>
            <p class="article-para">In the realm of human experience, there exists a profound yearning—a search for meaning, purpose, and connection beyond the material world. It is in this quest that spirituality emerges as a guiding light, offering solace, wisdom, and a deeper understanding of existence. Rooted in the recognition of something greater than ourselves, spirituality transcends religious doctrine and cultural boundaries, inviting individuals to explore the depths of their innermost being.<br><br>Spirituality, at its core, is a journey of self-discovery—a quest to uncover the essence of one&#x27;s soul and forge a deeper connection with the universe. It encompasses a myriad of practices, beliefs, and rituals, ranging from meditation and prayer to acts of kindness and compassion. While organized religions may provide a framework for spiritual exploration, spirituality itself transcends any single dogma or creed, embracing the diversity of humanexperience.<br><br>In this imperfect world, the only perfect thing we all believe in is God. Imagine spirituality as a tree, with God as its root and humanity as its branches. Just as the roots nourish and sustain the tree, providing stability and nourishment, so too does the divine essence permeate all aspects of existence, guiding and uplifting each individual on their journey and just as the branches of a tree are diverse in shape, size, and form, so too are the myriad expressions of spirituality found among humanity. Yet, despite our differences, we all share a common origin—a deep-rooted connection to the divine.<br><br>Consider the example of two individuals who follow different spiritual paths—one may find solace in the serenity of nature, communing with the sacredness of the earth, while the other may seek enlightenment through meditation and contemplation, delving into the depths of their inner being. Both paths are valid expressions of spirituality, reflecting the unique journey of each individual soul.<br><br>What sets spirituality apart is its inherent inclusivity and universality. Unlike rigid religious doctrines that may prescribe specific beliefs and practices, spirituality embraces the diversity of human experience, recognizing that each individual&#x27;s journey is uniquely their own. It celebrates the interconnectedness of all living beings, acknowledging that while we may be diverse in our expressions, we are united by a common source—the divine spark within us all.<br><br>In a world where the quest for uniqueness often leads to division and discord, spirituality offers a path towards unity and harmony. It reminds us that despite our differences, we are all interconnected—a part of the greater tapestry of existence. As we journey through life&#x27;s ever-changing landscape, let us embrace the richness of spiritual diversity and celebrate the unique essence that resides within each and every one of us.<br><br>-Ritesh Chavan<br></p>

            <h1 class="h2-d">TYPES OF ENGINEERING STUDENTS</h1>
            <p class="article-para">1. The Coffee Connoisseur:<br>&quot;Bhai, ye wala cappuccino bahut weak hai yaar. Gimme a double shot espresso, extra strong!&quot;This student runs on pure caffeine. Blood? Optional. Coffee? Essential. They can identify a barista from a mile away and have a running tab longer than a semester&#x27;s rent!<br><br>2. The Social Butterfly:<br>&quot;Yo, CGPA toh thik hai, par placement prep kaise chal raha hai?&quot;This student is the life of the college. They juggle academics with a vibrant social life, participating in every cultural event, college fest, and departmental competition. They&#x27;re the connector, the organizer, and the friend everyone knows.They are able to manage a packed schedule that includes both academics and social activities.Lectures? Meh. Networking events with free food? Absolutely! They know everyone from the dean to the chai-walla outside the hostel (on a first-name basis, of course).<br><br>3. The Eternal Optimist:<br>&quot;Chill yaar, ho  jaayega! Deadline toh abhi bahut दूर hai.&quot;This student sees the glass as half full, even when it&#x27;s actually empty and covered in pizza boxes. They believe in the power of positive thinking (and maybe a little all-nighter) to conquer any challenge. Deadlines become mere suggestions, and professors marvel at their unwavering enthusiasm, even in the face of overwhelming workloads.<br><br>4. The Sleep-Deprived      Samurai:<br>&quot;Abhi ek aur coffee aur main tyaar hoon raat bhar jagne ke liye!&quot;This student fights a constant battle against sleep. Armed with dark circles and a bottomless cup of chai, they navigate the semester in a perpetual state of exhaustion. Yet, somehow, they manage to pull off decent grades (just don&#x27;t ask them to explain the intricacies of thermodynamics at 3 AM).<br><br>5. The Procrastination Pro:<br>&quot;Deadline kab hai? Kal dekh lenge!&quot;This student is an expert in the art of putting things off. Deadlines become a game of chicken, and &quot;I&#x27;ll start tomorrow&quot; is their national anthem. They believe in the power of the eleventh-hour miracle. Presentations are a night-before scramble, fueled by endless cups of chai, questionable coding skills, and a generous dose of Jugaad (resourcefulness). While they might give their professors heart attacks, they somehow manage to pull off (mostly) functional projects at the last minute.<br><br>6. The Group Project Guru:<br>&quot;Tension mat le yaar, main group project handle kar lunga!&quot;This student is the master of collaboration (or maybe just delegation). They&#x27;ll charm, cajole, and bribe their way into a dream group project, leaving others to stress while they maintain a zen-like calm.<br><br>7. The Internship Obsessed:<br>&quot;Bhai, woh company internship ke liye kya puchhti hai?&quot;This student has their resume polished and ready before the semester even starts. Their sole focus is landing the perfect internship. They&#x27;ll network like a pro, research every company under the sun, and leave you wondering if they ever crack open a textbook.<br><br>8. The Existential Engineer:<br>&quot;Is there a point to calculating beam loads when the universe is vast and unknowable?&quot;This student questions everything. The meaning of life? The purpose of circuits? Why are we here? They spend more time contemplating the universe than calculating beam loads. They are just pondering the big questions while staring at an engineering diagram.They believe there&#x27;s more to engineering than just formulas and calculations. They are deep thinkers who seek to understand the bigger picture. <br><br>9. The Textbook Devotee: <br>&quot;Maine toh poori textbook underline kar li hai!&quot;This student worships at the altar of textbooks. They highlight, underline, and take meticulous notes. They can quote formulas like scripture and believe the key to success lies in pure knowledge absorption. They find comfort in the smell of fresh textbooks.<br><br>10. The Jugaadu Engineer: <br>&quot;Battery dead hai? Koi baat nahi, lecture notes phone pe hi padh lenge!&quot; This student is the king (or queen) of jugaad - the art of improvisation with limited resources. Armed with a swiss army knife, a roll of duct tape, and a can-do attitude, they can fix anything from a broken phone charger to a malfunctioning lab experiment (well, maybe not everything...). They see solutions where others see problems.<br><br>11. The Fitness Freak:<br>&quot;Gym time khatam karke aa raha hun, class miss na karne dena!&quot;This student prioritizes their physical health alongside their academic pursuits. Early mornings are spent pumping iron, and evenings are dedicated to cardio. They believe a healthy body leads to a healthy mind (and maybe better exam results).<br><br>12. The Foodie Engineer:<br>&quot;Lecture bunk maar ke canteen mein kuch naya try karte hain?&quot;  This student has a passion for food that rivals their passion for engineering. They&#x27;re always up for exploring new restaurants, cafes, and hidden food gems around campus.  Sometimes, lectures get sacrificed in the pursuit of the perfect culinary experience. They are firm believers of good food is essential for a good mood.<br><br>13. The Backbench Bonanza:<br>“Backbench ka gyaan, frontbench bhi hairan”This student finds comfort (and maybe a nap) in the hallowed halls of the backbench. While professors drone on, they&#x27;re busy catching up on the latest movie, planning weekend outings, or perfecting their PUBG skills (shhh!). But don&#x27;t underestimate them – they possess a mysterious ability to ace exams with minimal preparation.<br><br>14. The Placement Purist:<br>&quot;CGPA toh theek hai, lekin placement zyada matter karta hai!&quot;This student is laser-focused on securing the dream placement. Their world revolves around internships, aptitude tests, and interview skills workshops. They&#x27;re the first ones to arrive for placement presentations and the last ones to leave, grilling the recruiters with meticulous questions. They have a five-year plan mapped out, starting with that dream job. They spend more time practicing mock interviews than attending lectures. <br><br>15. The R&amp;D Rockstar:<br>&quot;Theory kam, Experiment zyada, Ye R&amp;D ka funda!&quot;This student dreams of pushing the boundaries of engineering and making a real impact on the world. Their passion lies in research and development, and they&#x27;re always tinkering with new ideas and inventions. Labs are their playgrounds, and professors become their mentors in the pursuit of groundbreaking discoveries.<br><br>16. The Professor&#x27;s Pet:<br>&quot;Extra credit ka मौका? Batao kab hai!&quot;This student is the professor&#x27;s favorite. They&#x27;re always raising their hand in class, participating in discussions, and seeking extra learning opportunities. While some might call them a &quot;chamcha&quot; (sycophant), they genuinely enjoy the pursuit of knowledge and appreciate the professor&#x27;s guidance.<br><br>17. The Night Owl:<br>&quot;Rat ki aankhein, किताबों ka sahara, Raat meri Shakti, Gyaan ka Sahara!&quot;This student operates on a different time zone. While others hit the sack early, they come alive at night.  Libraries become their havens, filled with the glow of computer screens and the rustle of turning pages. Fueled by endless cups of chai (or maybe stronger coffee!), they conquer complex engineering concepts in the wee hours of the morning. They find inspiration striking most often in the quiet solitude of the night.<br><br>18. The Timely Titans:<br>Aakhri minute ki bhagdaud nahin, pehle se hi sab kuchh taiyaar!The antithesis of the Procrastinators, these students are paragons of organization. Deadlines are met weeks in advance, projects are meticulously planned, and presentations are polished to perfection.  They might seem a little uptight to their more relaxed counterparts, but professors love their dedication and efficiency.<br><br>19. Club Cooligans:<br>“Meetings aur masti, hum hain Club Walonki hasti”This group considers the college club their second home. They&#x27;re there for every meeting (or at least most of them), leading initiatives, planning events, and generally keeping the college buzzing with activity. Academics might take a backseat to club commitments, but they learn valuable leadership and teamwork skills along the way.<br><br>20. The Casual Clubber:<br>“Experience ke liye join kiya, ab aana hua mood par”This student joins a club &quot;for the experience,&quot; but their commitment level is...well, casual. They might show up for the occasional event or free food, but their main focus is on academics (or maybe just naps).  There&#x27;s nothing wrong with this approach, but they might miss out on the full benefits of club involvement.<br><br>21. The All-Rounder:<br>“Class mein topper, stage pe dhamaal! Yeh hai all-rounder ka kamaal!”This student is the epitome of well-roundedness. They maintain good grades, participate actively in extracurricular activities, represent the college at cultural events, and even manage to maintain a healthy social life. They&#x27;re the envy of their peers and the role models for younger students (though they might secretly be running on fumes by the end of the semester).<br><br>22. The Friend Zone Favorite:<br>“Har kisi ki madad ke liye taiyar, kabhi na kahne wala yaar”This friendly soul is everyone&#x27;s best friend. They&#x27;re always willing to lend a helping hand, offer a listening ear, or explain a complex concept for the nth time.  While their social calendar is full, their academic performance might suffer slightly due to their selfless nature.<br><br>23. The Sarcastic Sage:<br>&quot;Deadline ki tension mat le, professor teri masterpiece ke liye saans rok kar wait karenge.&quot;This student has a dry wit and a sharp tongue. Their seemingly harsh comments are often laced with truth and disguised concern. They might point out flaws in your project or poke fun at your study habits, but ultimately, they just want to see you succeed.<br><br>- Divya Gulhane<br><br></p>

            <p class="article-para"> In this huge universe we live in there are plenty of things that make us sometimes happy and sometimes sad. All of us are in different phases of our life with each phase filled with different sufferings and happy moments. This all always trying to teach us that every day is not the same for anybody. Everyone is in their race and trying to win it. But the harsh truth is only 1% will going to be winner. But what about the rest 99%. If You unfortunately failed then the question will always will be there “Oh God, why always me? I gave my best.” If God could answer then he also would have said that “It is not the time yet, don’t you lose hope and try harder next time.” But after trying many times again and again then also you failed then the answer you got previously get vanishes because you have lost all the hopes. <br><br>When you lose then you get to feel that I am the worst one, I cannot do anything good in my life. But sometimes the perspective about these things is also important. If you will try to break concrete wall with your hand then it is obvious that you will always fail. So, you always need to understand firstly for what exactly you are made for. Materialistic thing or a high-status post in any organisation or company should not be your goal. The final motive should be being happy in it what you do. Not every passion needs to be get monetized. Somethings you should do the things for happiness of your soul.<br><br>“If you judge a fish by aim to climb a mountain then that Fish will spend whole life has a loser only”<br>– Albert Einstein <br><br>Persons with the same dream cannot have same life. Each person varies with other person in multiple aspect because everyone has lived their life in a different way. Every one of us are unique and special one in different ways. So, you do not need compare yourself with other on basis of a single competition or race. If you cannot do one thing after multiple attempts then leave it because you can do other 3 things better than that one. So, whenever you feel that I am alone and stuck in illusive know where then remind every time to yourself that you are the special one that why you are alone.<br><br>-Pranay Ingle<br></p>

            <h1 class="h2-d">Bermuda Triangle</h1>
            <p class="article-para">In the vast expanse of the Atlantic Ocean lies a region shrouded in mystery and intrigue—the Bermuda Triangle. Also known as the Devil&#x27;s Triangle, this enigmatic stretch of water has captured the imagination of explorers, scientists, and conspiracy theorists alike, sparking countless theories and speculations about its purported supernatural phenomena.<br><br>The Bermuda Triangle is roughly bounded by Miami, Bermuda, and Puerto Rico, forming a triangular area of approximately 500,000 square miles. Over the years, numerous ships and aircraft have reportedly vanished without a trace within its confines, giving rise to tales of inexplicable disappearances and paranormal activity.<br><br>One of the most famous incidents associated with the Bermuda Triangle occurred in1945, when Flight 19—a squadron of five U.S. Navy bombers—vanished during a routine training mission. Despite extensive search efforts, neither the aircraft nor the 14 crew member swere ever found. Similarly, the disappearance of the SS Marine Sulphur Queen in 1963, along with its 39 crew members, remains an unsolved mystery to this day. What sets the Bermuda Triangle apart is not only the sheer number of disappearances attributed to it but also the diverse range of theories proposed to explain its phenomena. From magnetic anomalies and underwater methane gas eruptions to extraterrestrial interference and time warps, the Bermuda Triangle has inspired a plethora of hypotheses, each more fantastical than the last.<br><br>In a world where the unknown often breeds fear and fascination, the Bermuda Triangle stands as a testament to the enduring allure of mystery. Despite decades of scientific scrutiny, its secrets remain elusive, defying rational explanation and inviting speculation about the hidden forces at play within its waters. As we ponder the enigma of the Bermuda Triangle, let us not forget the importance of skepticism and critical inquiry in unraveling its mysteries. While the allure of the unknown may tempt us to embrace fantastical explanations, it is through careful observation and empirical investigation that we may eventually unlock the truth behind this unique phenomenon. Until then, the Bermuda Triangle will continue to captivate our imaginations, reminding us of the boundless mysteries that lie waiting to be discovered in the depths of the sea.<br><br>-Ritesh Chavan</p>

            <h1 class="h2-d">Dark matter</h1>
            <p class="article-para">In the vast expanse of the universe, amidst the twinkling stars and swirling galaxies, exists a mysterious substance that defies detection and challenges our understanding of the cosmos—dark matter. Unlike the ordinary matter that makes up stars, planets, and everything we can see, dark matter remains invisible to telescopes and eludes direct detection, yet its presence exerts a powerful gravitational influence on the cosmos.                 <br><br>Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible to traditional methods of observation. Despite its elusive nature, scientists infer the existence of dark matter through its gravitational effects on visible matter and the large-scale structure of the universe.                  <br><br>One compelling example of dark matter&#x27;s influence can be seen in the rotation curves of galaxies. Observations have revealed that the outer regions of galaxies rotate at higher speeds than would be expected based on the distribution of visible matter alone. This anomaly suggests the presence of an unseen mass—dark matter—that provides the gravitational tug necessary to keep galaxies from flying apart.                     <br><br>Additionally, the phenomenon of gravitational lensing, where the gravity of massive objects bends and distorts light from more distant objects, offers further evidence for the existence of dark matter. By studying the subtle distortions in the light from background galaxies, astronomers can map the distribution of dark matter within galaxy clusters and across the cosmos.                       <br><br>What sets dark matter apart is not only its enigmatic nature but also its fundamental role in shaping the universe as we know it. While ordinary matter—such as stars, planets, and interstellar gas—constitutes only a small fraction of the total mass-energy content of the universe, dark matter comprises the vast majority, exerting a gravitational pull that binds galaxies together and drives the cosmic dance of celestial bodies.                        <br><br>In a universe teeming with wonders and mysteries, dark matter stands as a testament to the enduring quest for knowledge and understanding. Its invisible presence underscores the inherent limitations of human perception and the boundless complexity of the cosmos. As scientists continue to unravel the secrets of dark matter, they embark on a journey of discovery that promises to deepen our appreciation for the universe&#x27;s rich tapestry and the hidden forces that shape our cosmic home.            <br><br>-Vaishnavi Hatkangane<br></p>

            <h1 class="h2-d">Doppler effect</h1>
            <p class="article-para">In the realm of physics, few phenomena capture the imagination quite like the Doppler effect. This fascinating principle, first described by Austrian physicist Christian Doppler in 1842, illuminates the subtle yet profound changes in frequency and wavelength that occur when a sound or light source is in motion relative to an observer. From the familiar sound of a passing ambulance to the cosmic dance of distant galaxies, the Doppler effect manifests in myriad ways, offering insights into the dynamic nature of our universe.<br><br>At its core, the Doppler effect describes the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave—such as sound or light—due to the relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer. When an object emitting waves moves towards an observer, the waves are compressed, resulting in an increase in frequency and a higher pitch (for sound) or a shift towards the blue end of the spectrum (for light). Conversely, when the object moves away from the observer, the waves are stretched, causing a decrease in frequency and a lower pitch (for sound) or a shift towards the red end of the spectrum (for light).<br><br>One of the most common examples of the Doppler effect can be observed in everyday life when an ambulance or police car with its siren blaring passes by. As the vehicle approaches, the sound waves are compressed, producing a higher pitch that is perceived as a loud, shrill noise. Conversely, as the vehicle moves away, the sound waves are stretched, resulting in a lower pitch that gradually fades into the distance.<br><br>In the realm of astronomy, the Doppler effect plays a crucial role in determining the motion of celestial objects. By analyzing the spectral lines emitted by stars and galaxies, astronomers can infer whether these objects are moving towards or away from Earth, providing valuable insights into the structure and dynamics of the universe.<br><br>What sets the Doppler effect apart is its versatility and ubiquity, manifesting in a wide range of phenomena across different scales and disciplines. From the mundane to the cosmic, the Doppler effect offers a window into the dynamic interactions between objects in motion and the waves they emit or reflect.<br><br>In a universe filled with complexities and wonders, the Doppler effect stands as a reminder of the interconnectedness of all things and the subtle yet profound ways in which motion shapes our perception of the world around us. As we continue to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos, let us not overlook the timeless wisdom embodied in this remarkable phenomenon—the timeless quest for truth and understanding that transcends the bounds of space and time.<br><br>- Isha Sangnale<br></p>

            <h1 class="h2-d">Overthinking</h1>
            <p class="article-para">Overthinking, a labyrinth of thoughts that ensnares the mind, is a phenomenon as complex as the human psyche itself. It manifests in myriad forms, from incessant worrying about the past and future to ruminating over every decision and action. But what truly defines overthinking? Is it merely an expression of cringe-worthy concerns, or does it encompass a broader spectrum of mental processes?<br><br>At its core, overthinking can be understood as a cognitive loop, wherein the mind becomes trapped in repetitive and often unproductive patterns of thought. For some, it may manifest as incessant worrying, a relentless cycle of &quot;what ifs&quot; and worst-case scenarios that overshadow the present moment. For others, it may take the form of rumination, where past events are replayed ad infinitum, leading to feelings of regret, guilt, or resentment.<br><br>However, it is essential to recognize that overthinking is not solely confined to negative thoughts or emotions. In some instances, it may manifest as excessive planning and analysis, as individuals strive to anticipate every possible outcome and mitigate potential risks. While this meticulous attention to detail can be beneficial in certain contexts, such as problem-solving or decision-making, it can also lead to paralysis by analysis, preventing individuals from taking action or embracing spontaneity.<br><br>Furthermore, the perception of what constitutes overthinking is inherently subjective and can vary greatly from one individual to another. What may seem like an innocuous thought pattern to one person may be perceived as overwhelming or debilitating to another. Likewise, the triggers and underlying causes of overthinking can be deeply personal, rooted in past experiences, traumas, or learned behaviors.<br><br>In light of this diversity of experiences, it is crucial to approach the topic of overthinking with understanding, and an appreciation for the uniqueness of each individual&#x27;s capacity for thought and response. Rather than labeling certain thought patterns as inherently &quot;cringe-worthy&quot; or unproductive, we should strive to cultivate a culture of self-awareness and acceptance, where individuals feel empowered to explore and navigate their inner landscapes without judgment or shame.<br><br>Moreover, instead of viewing overthinking as a purely negative phenomenon, we can reframe it as an opportunity for growth and self-discovery. By acknowledging and interrogating the underlying beliefs, fears, and assumptions that fuel our overactive minds, we can gain valuable insights into our thought processes and develop healthier coping mechanisms.<br><br>Rather than striving to eliminate overthinking altogether, we could strive to cultivate a balanced and mindful approach to our thoughts and emotions, recognizing that our capacity for thought is as unique and complex as the human experience itself.<br><br>- Isha Sangnale</p>

            <h1 class="h2-d"> The tree that stands out</h1>
            <p class="article-para"> The tree that stands out.<br>Thousands of visitors visit the world heritage site of the Ellora caves and the spectacular Kailash Temple which is a testament to the marvelous architecture that dates back to the 6th century AD.<br><br>The caves are an astounding example of human intelligence and its understanding of the concepts of architecture, design and precision. This region is also blessed with impressive natural beauty. The caves are surrounded by trees and hills which are not of course as ancient as or as attractive as the caves but need to be admired, not just at this place but at every place of importance ‘for who can be a better creator than the lord almighty, who created us all. ’There are two things that I look forward to when a trip to the caves is planned; the first is the waterfall that runs perpendicular through the cave line falling from a height of over 100 meters (only in monsoons though!) , and second the primary subject of this article is the perennial “TREE”.<br><br>At the entrance of the Kailash Temple at Ellora on your right when you face the temple is this tree which has its tentacles spread out (if you have seen Harry Potter you may remember the Whomping Willow) furthermore it feels as if it is looking at us, wavering its form leaf-less sometimes, full of leaves sometimes.<br><br>The tree can be seen as a testament to the concept of one-of-a-kind, in its wholeness it has a distinct charm to it with its perfectly tree like shape that we are used to drawing in the monsoons to the way in which it stands out through the extremely dry season of summer. Also to add an observation, the circular pavement around the tree is covered with grass all year round and surprisingly even when the tree is barren of leaves and the surroundings are brown in summers, the grass on the pavement is still green! This picture taken in the month of March 2024 justifies the same.<br><br>What can be perceived here is that the tree in its own being, its roots deep around the rocks, foundations of the magnificent Kailash Temple, its leaves and branches surrounded by the lush gardens maintained by the ASI; but the tree is in sync with the nature while refusing to blend in its surrounding it makes a statement, a statement that no matter how great your peers, your neighbors and your environment what matters most is ‘you’ because you are an inseparable part of the universe, a one of its kind creation and a single entity in the equation of the universe. The tree reminds us to bloom, grow, prosper in a way that suits us, in a way that we are comfortable with, in a way that makes us happy. It shows us how to stand out without standing alone, it can also be seen as humbled by the presence of the Kailash Temple and humbleness goes a long way! The caves are immortal in most senses, they have existed for centuries and they will exist for centuries to come; the tree a mortal being with its limited years is fulfilling its karma to stand tall through the days rainy and sunny, through the weekends and weekdays greeting visitors from worldwide at this World Heritage Site standing tall and confident in its oneness. <br><br>- Rahi Gaikwad</p>

            <h1 class="h2-d">ANXIETY UNMASKED: SHEDDING LIGHT ON THE SILENT STRUGGLE</h1>
            <p class="article-para">Imagine waking up in the morning, feeling the weight of the day ahead pressing down on your chest like a boulder. Your mind races with million of thoughts , each one more overwhelming than the last. You try to get out of the bed but your body feels like it’s encased in cement ,immobilized by the fear of facing the day. This is just one moment in the life of someone grappling with anxiety , where even the simplest task can feel like insurmountable obstacles or picture yourself standing in a crowded room surrounded by people chatting and laughing. despite the noise and activity ,you feel isolated in your own bubble of worry. Your heart races , palm sweat and every breath feels shallow as if the air is too thick to inhale. You try to join the conversation ,but the fear of saying the wrong thing or being judged paralyzes you. You plaster on a smile, hoping no one notices the turmoil churning inside you. This is the invisible battle of anxiety, where every social interaction becomes a battlefield of self doubt and apprehension.<br><br>In my own journey with anxiety , I’ve often find myself in situations similar to the ones described above. The most recent one was during one of our tests, I was terribly anxious before the test , things changed for the worse during the test, My palms were sweaty and started spasming ,even holding the pen became difficult ,consequently my hands were shivering and ultimately I couldn’t concentrate in the paper well and messed up with the calculations. Finally ended up at home weeping due to my inability to reproduce my knowledge properly during the test. Apart from this I’ve experienced suffocating grip of social anxiety, where every heartbeat feels deafeningly loud ,and every glance in my direction feels like a spotlight highlighting my insecurities .these personal experiences have given me a firsthand understanding of the debilitating effect of anxiety. To my dismay , I’ve never had someone understanding my condition in all these years ,never did anyone lend a helping hand to make me feel better. Instead I was often accused to be overreacting and exaggerating my situation , which would further worsen my condition. It’s a pity that in a country where around 7.3% of population experience anxiety disorders, Mental health disorders are still not taken as seriously as other physical disorders and seeking medical help for the same is still considered as taboo.<br><br>In our society, the insensitivity towards individuals struggling with anxiety can be particularly pronounced due to societal stigmas surrounding mental health. Many people may dismiss anxiety as a character flaw or a sign of weakness, rather than recognizing it as a legitimate medical condition. Instead of offering support and empathy, individuals with anxiety are often met with judgment, criticism, or even ridicule. In social settings, there&#x27;s often a lack of awareness about the nuances of anxiety disorders, leading to insensitive comments or actions that further exacerbate the suffering of those affected. Phrases like &quot;just relax&quot; or &quot;stop worrying so much&quot; trivialize the complex nature of anxiety and invalidate the experiences of those struggling with it. Moreover, the expectation of always appearing strong and composed in Indian culture can add an additional layer of pressure on individuals with anxiety, making it even more difficult for them to seek help or speak openly about their struggles.<br><br>Overall, anxiety is a pervasive and often misunderstood mental health issue that affects millions of individuals worldwide, including a significant portion of the population in India. Despite its prevalence, the insensitivity and stigma surrounding anxiety persist, creating barriers to understanding and support. It&#x27;s imperative for society to recognize the debilitating impact of anxiety and work towards fostering a culture of empathy, acceptance, and support for those affected. By raising awareness, promoting open dialogue, and prioritizing mental health education and resources, we can create a more inclusive and compassionate environment where individuals struggling with anxiety feel heard, understood, and empowered to seek the help they deserve. Together, we can break the silence surrounding anxiety and pave the way towards a healthier, more supportive future for all. <br><br>-PRADEEPTA KAR<br></p>

            <h1 class="h2-d">PEOPLE ARE NOT FOR RELIGION</h1>
            <p class="article-para">  I find the ideas and concepts presented by Rajneesh very suitable and logically sound. The  explanation of God cannot be entirely logical, as God and logic are inherently contradictory. However,  the non-existence of God and its correlation with logic can be well established, as it makes complete  sense. When a child is in trouble, they instinctively seek their mother for care and support. This  creates a sense of being backed up, and from this simple idea, the concept of God evolves hand in  hand. Let me delve into Rajneesh&#x27;s discussions for further clarification and with him I too say that:  “God is the greatest lie invented by a man because man feels so helpless, so afraid of death, so  burdened with life&#x27;s problems, and because he has been raised by a father and by a mother, and  those were the beautiful days - no responsibility, no worries; somebody was taking care of him/her.  That psychological childhood is projected into all religions: God becomes the father, and there are  few religions in which God becomes the mother. It is a simple psychological projection of a child; it  has no basis in reality. And whenever you are afraid, and when you are in trouble, you start seeking  help. But no help ever comes. Even Jesus on the cross was waiting for help to come and finally got  disappointed and shouted, &quot;Father, have you forsaken me?&quot; A great doubt must have arisen in him, a  great question - nothing is happening. And he was believing all these years that God would come to  save him, his son, but nobody came. Jesus Christ must have died in utter disillusionment. I don’t have  any illusion; I cannot be disillusioned. I do not believe God does not exist; I know for sure he does not exist. And thank God that he does  not exist, because the existence of God would have created so many problems, difficulties that life  would have been almost impossible. You may not have looked at it from this angle, from which I am  going to talk with you. Perhaps nobody has ever tried to look at it from this angle. The Christians say  God created the world. In fact, the hypothesis of God is needed for the creation; the world is there,  somebody must have created it. Whoever created it, the creator is God. But do you see the  implication? If the world is created, then there can be no evolution. Evolution means that creation  continues. Think of the Christian story: God created the world in six days, and then on the seventh  day, he rested. Since then, he has been resting. The whole creation was completed in six days. Now,  from where can evolution have possibilities? Creation means finished; the full stop has arrived on the  sixth day - the full stop. And after that, there is no possibility of creation. Evolution implies that  creation is not complete; hence the possibility of evolving. But God cannot create an incomplete  world; that would be going against God&#x27;s nature. He is perfect, and whatsoever he does is perfect.  Neither is he evolving, nor is the world evolving; everything is at a standstill. Death. This is the reason  why popes were against Darwin - that man was bringing ideas which were in contradiction. They  could see the far-reaching implication of the idea of evolution. Ordinarily, you would not connect  creation and evolution. What connection is there for God and Darwin? There is a connection. Charles  Darwin is that the creation is an ongoing process; that existence is always imperfect, is never going to  be perfect. Only then will it be evolving, reaching new peaks and dimensions, new possibilities. God  had finished his work in six days, and not long ago, four thousand and four years before Jesus Christ  was born. It must have been the first of January, Monday, because we manage to fit God into  everything that we have created; he has to follow our calendar. If you ask me, it must have been  Monday, the first of April, the Fool&#x27;s Day, because that day seems to be absolutely suitable for doing  such an act of creating a complete, ready-made existence.” Some religions believe in the existence of God, while others do not. So, what&#x27;s the deal with religion,  you may ask? Isn&#x27;t religion connected to God? No, counter. Instead, I propose the larger question: Is  religion not for people? I say and quote that religion is for people; people are not for religion. I find it  absolutely ridiculous and utterly absurd that people fight over some imaginary concept for which  they are not even sure. A person born in India has a good chance of being Hindu, while in Italy,  Christianity prevails. In fact, religion binds people; it makes them sane and encourages them to do  good tasks. Religion, in essence, serves to unite people, fostering sanity and inspiring altruistic deeds. But when it reaches an extreme level, we must recognize there are some problems because religion  is not the ultimate truth; it is we who make it the truth and give meaning to it. Then, what is the  ultimate religion, you may ask? And I find it very simple to answer and very obvious: HUMANITY. It is  the only religion I perceive to be above all other man-made religions because man cannot make  humanity; humanity exists as man exists. People may create new religions and assign gods and  goddesses, but humanity can&#x27;t be created; it is the only religion which, in fact, aligns with the  concept of religion. <br><br>- Vivek Lankeshwar<br></p>

            <h1 class="h2-d">Angkor Wat, the 8th wonder of the world.</h1>
            <p class="article-para">The temple city in deep forests of Cambodia which was built as a Hindu temple complex, converted as a Buddhist one, neglected over the years, but never abandoned, later rediscovered, conserved and now highly recognized; originally known as Vrah Vishnuloka, abode of Vishnu, now known as Angkor Wat. Recently, the 12th century temple complex inherited the tag of the 8th wonder of the world extending the list of monuments which includes, Great Wall of China: China, Petra: Jordan, Christ the Redeemer: Brazil, Machu Picchu: Peru, Chichen Itza: Mexico, Roman Colosseum: Italy, Taj Mahal: India.<br><br>The temple complex, the largest in the world has stood the test of time and survived for nearly 9 centuries. This article is an informative note about details and some facts about the architectural marvel of Angkor Wat. The temple complex was built by King Suryavarman II of the Khymer dynasty. Covering around 400 acers this marvellous structure took over 3 decades to be built. It is near the city of Siĕmréab, Cambodia. The structure comprises of more than a thousand buildings all built in the Khymer style of architecture.<br><br>The name Angkor Wat translates to &#x27;temple city&#x27;, and this city used to be the center of the political and spiritual activities of the kingdom. Built as a temple dedicated to the Hindu gods, Bramha, Vishnu, and Shiv, some people believe that the temple originally was built as a spiritual palace for God Vishnu. The temple structure has five central towers representing the Mount Meru which according to the scriptures of Hinduism and Buddhism is said to be the dwelling place of the Gods. The moat surrounding the temple is represents the sea towards the end of the world. This moat is connected to many canals that run across the city providing water throughout and glorifying the engineering abilities of the civilization that had existed. A bridge through this moat provides access to the temple which has walls of over 12 feet and 3 pavement galleries with relics prior to entering the main complex. <br><br>The walls of these pavements are lined with beautiful sculptures of scenes from the Ramayana, Mahabharata and deities of both religions. It is believed that the complex also housed the residential area of the people, the kings palace as well as the markets but keeping with the tradition at that time all the structures except the temple and surrounding wall were made of wood and other less durable material while durable materials like sandstone were used to build the former. Hence the other structures were unable to stand the test of time. There&#x27;s a fact that states that more sandstone blocks were used to build it as compared to the Pyramids of Giza! There are many structures like libraries, galleries and ponds made with immense symmetry and mathematical precision in the complex.Historians still are researching the purpose for which the temple was built, contrary to all Hindu temples that face east this temple complex faces the west which makes a possibility of it having been built as a mausoleum for king Suryavarman II. Some believe that his body is buried under the central structure of the temple.<br><br>There is a lot of debate as to why the temple was converted from a Hindu structure to a Buddhist structure. Some believe that the succeeding king Jayavarman VII said that Hindu gods had failed him once while he was attacked hence he converted to buddhism, while others argue of invasion and battle losses, or shift of faith in the kingdom. The temple houses a large idol of Ashtabhuja Vishnu (God Vishnu with 8 hands) and Lord Buddha sleeping on Sheshnag (the serpent king). The Sheshnag is also considered to be the bed of Vishnu hence the idols confirm that people then believed Buddha to be an avatar (incarnation) of Vishnu. In the later times the temple was also a witness to civil wars, conflicts, freedom struggles and restoration drives. The bullet marks on the walls, some damaged structures and preservation marks tell us this.<br><br>Today tourists from various faiths, visit Angkor Wat and marvel at its immense structural beauty, it&#x27;s legends and precision. It is a heritage and a testament from our ancestors that underlines the peaks of architecture, engineering and design that they had reached.<br><br>- Rahi Gaikwad</p>
