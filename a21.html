            <h1 class="h2-d">Angkor Wat, the 8th wonder of the world.</h1>
            <p class="article-para">The temple city in deep forests of Cambodia which was built as a Hindu temple complex, converted as a Buddhist one, neglected over the years, but never abandoned, later rediscovered, conserved and now highly recognized; originally known as Vrah Vishnuloka, abode of Vishnu, now known as Angkor Wat. Recently, the 12th century temple complex inherited the tag of the 8th wonder of the world extending the list of monuments which includes, Great Wall of China: China, Petra: Jordan, Christ the Redeemer: Brazil, Machu Picchu: Peru, Chichen Itza: Mexico, Roman Colosseum: Italy, Taj Mahal: India.<br><br>The temple complex, the largest in the world has stood the test of time and survived for nearly 9 centuries. This article is an informative note about details and some facts about the architectural marvel of Angkor Wat. The temple complex was built by King Suryavarman II of the Khymer dynasty. Covering around 400 acers this marvellous structure took over 3 decades to be built. It is near the city of Siĕmréab, Cambodia. The structure comprises of more than a thousand buildings all built in the Khymer style of architecture.<br><br>The name Angkor Wat translates to &#x27;temple city&#x27;, and this city used to be the center of the political and spiritual activities of the kingdom. Built as a temple dedicated to the Hindu gods, Bramha, Vishnu, and Shiv, some people believe that the temple originally was built as a spiritual palace for God Vishnu. The temple structure has five central towers representing the Mount Meru which according to the scriptures of Hinduism and Buddhism is said to be the dwelling place of the Gods. The moat surrounding the temple is represents the sea towards the end of the world. This moat is connected to many canals that run across the city providing water throughout and glorifying the engineering abilities of the civilization that had existed. A bridge through this moat provides access to the temple which has walls of over 12 feet and 3 pavement galleries with relics prior to entering the main complex. <br><br>The walls of these pavements are lined with beautiful sculptures of scenes from the Ramayana, Mahabharata and deities of both religions. It is believed that the complex also housed the residential area of the people, the kings palace as well as the markets but keeping with the tradition at that time all the structures except the temple and surrounding wall were made of wood and other less durable material while durable materials like sandstone were used to build the former. Hence the other structures were unable to stand the test of time. There&#x27;s a fact that states that more sandstone blocks were used to build it as compared to the Pyramids of Giza! There are many structures like libraries, galleries and ponds made with immense symmetry and mathematical precision in the complex.Historians still are researching the purpose for which the temple was built, contrary to all Hindu temples that face east this temple complex faces the west which makes a possibility of it having been built as a mausoleum for king Suryavarman II. Some believe that his body is buried under the central structure of the temple.<br><br>There is a lot of debate as to why the temple was converted from a Hindu structure to a Buddhist structure. Some believe that the succeeding king Jayavarman VII said that Hindu gods had failed him once while he was attacked hence he converted to buddhism, while others argue of invasion and battle losses, or shift of faith in the kingdom. The temple houses a large idol of Ashtabhuja Vishnu (God Vishnu with 8 hands) and Lord Buddha sleeping on Sheshnag (the serpent king). The Sheshnag is also considered to be the bed of Vishnu hence the idols confirm that people then believed Buddha to be an avatar (incarnation) of Vishnu. In the later times the temple was also a witness to civil wars, conflicts, freedom struggles and restoration drives. The bullet marks on the walls, some damaged structures and preservation marks tell us this.<br><br>Today tourists from various faiths, visit Angkor Wat and marvel at its immense structural beauty, it&#x27;s legends and precision. It is a heritage and a testament from our ancestors that underlines the peaks of architecture, engineering and design that they had reached.<br><br>- Rahi Gaikwad</p>
